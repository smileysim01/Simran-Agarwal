            We've already taken it was up for sale to Nike+ members at that point, but now it's finally available to the general public. The look is playful, and the cushioning is innovative. If you're the kind of person who doesn't like running but would like to like it, this might just be the shoe for you.

                There's not much to say about this sneaker that you can't already see: It's a Stan Smith with an embossed snake upper. Simple as that. But, then again, when the final execution is this striking, why complicate things?

                    We saw Nice Kicks collaborate with Adidas on the NMD R1 a few years back, and now they're at it again, creating this tie-dyed pair along with Woodstock to honour the 50th anniversary of the festival. Although the hype around Ultra Boost has died down considerably, the colourful upper and gum soles are undeniably fun.

                        This patent leather AJ1 is part of the "Fearless Ones" collection—and it's probably the most significant pair of the bunch. The colourway blends University Blue (for UNC) and Gym Red (for the Bulls) to pay homage to Jordan himself and the two teams that defined his career.

                            It's Gore-Tex season, also known as that time of year when constant cold and rain call for some sneakers that can stand up to the elements. Thankfully, Nike has us all covered with these Air Force 1s, which come in an array of colours (the khaki is a winner) and, of course, Gore-Tex to keep your feet dry.

                                    Legendary footwear boutique Atmos just dropped its latest collaboration and it’s a real stunner. The colourway draws inspiration from ‘90s sportswear and advertising imagery. It’s a loud, vibrant silhouette for sure but those who aren’t afraid of a little bit of colour are sure to look great in it.
